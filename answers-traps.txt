1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
f: x in a0
g: x in a0, and optimize at compile time, we will see function g doesn't call function f in asm
main: 13 in a2, 12 in a1.

2. Where is the call to funciton f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g?(Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
because of the inline functions, funciton f is "li	a1,12", function g doesn't exist.

3. At what address is the function printf located? 
0x628

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38

5. Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
little-endian: HE110 World  (57616 == 0xE110, 0x72=r. 0x6c=l, 0x64=d)
big   -endian: unsigned int i = 0x726c6400;

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? Why does it happen?
depend on register a2
